# Resetting your password or reclaiming your username

Whether you have to reset a forgotten password or remember the usernames associated with your {{brand}} account, you can do so via the {{gui}}.

## Reset lost password

Begin by navigating to the {{gui}}.
At the bottom left-hand side of the page, click on the "Forgot your password?" button.

Type in your username, then click on the "Reclaim password!" button.

The content of the pop-up window changes, informing you that an email has been sent to you with instructions on how to reset your password.

Click the "Ok!" button, then go ahead and check your inbox (or spam/junk folder) for an email with the subject **_Cleura Account password reset request_**.

Come up with a strong password and type it in twice, for security reasons.
Click the "Set new password" button when you are done.
You will be informed that the password has been reset, so click the "Go back to login page" button to login.

A pop-up window titled "Reclaim lost password!" appears.
Ignore the "Reclaim password!" button, and follow the link "I don't know my username" instead.

Now, the same pop-up window informs you that, provided the email address you just typed exists in the system, you will shortly receive a new email with your username.

Click the "Ok!" button, then go ahead and check your inbox (or spam/junk folder) for an email with the subject **_List of usernames for Cleura Cloud_**.
